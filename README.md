# Push Pin Tracker

A usefull app that aids designers in tracking revisions and client feedback through the iteration process.

## Overview

In that past when doing design work I have had frustrations with managing client and management feedback and revisions. Email is not well suited for such an iteration loop. This is an app that would allow a user/designer to upload an image, allow others to put pins in it, attach comments, add design revisions, and track those pins and comments through a feedback loop until resolved.
